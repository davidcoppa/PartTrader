            Requirement1:
            Work Order Tab, if you insert an invalid PartNumber, you'll have label under telling you the correct format.

            Requirement2::
            When you add a item in the Work Order, the system checks if the part exist in the exclusion list, if exist
            at the moment of send it to the server doesn't include in the items to PartTrader.

            Requirement3:
            When a Work Order item is added and doesn't exist in the exclusion list, the item is sended to the server to
            get the compatible parts, and added into the Work Order list.

            Overview
            <br>
            The key things we’re looking for are; code is readable, requirements are met, code composition is
            appropriate
            (all the good SOLID principle stuff), and tests are provided and pass.For a bit of guidance:It’s not about
            right
            or wrong answers, we want to use this exercise as a talking point to discuss how you approach the problem
            and
            the techniques you use.
            Once you’ve completed it, we’ll load it into our code review tool and ask some of our developers to review
            it,
            just like any code we ship to production. We’ll utilise that as the basis for reviewing the solution with
            you.The solution you submit should be reflective of what you would do to get the code ready for
            production.We
            encourage people to take their time and use it to help reflect their skills and knowledge to the extent that
            they feel does them justice.

            Task Outline
            <br>
            The PartsTrader team are developing a set of tools for use in third party repairer estimating software.
            These
            tools will provide the ability for repairers to lookup a given part and find all compatible parts that could
            be
            used instead. These tools are to be provided to the clients in the form of a simple REST API that they can
            reference within their own solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Background
            <br>
            PartsTrader maintains a large catalogue of vehicle parts providing mappings between various national and
            international standards. When repairers submit part information to PartsTrader, either when quoting or when
            simply looking up a part, PartsTrader will cache the part information (if it doesn't already know of the
            part)
            so as to be able to provide as full and complete a list of parts information as possible to other
            integrations.When creating work estimates repairers create a list of the parts need to repair a vehicle; for
            example, a car may require a new front wheel and a side mirror in order to be road worthy again. In many
            scenarios car parts are interchangeable; for example, a rear tail light for a 2014 Chevrolet Camaro might be
            the
            officially required part for a repair however a Ford Focus 2008 tail light may be either the exact same part
            or
            a close enough replacement. In order to maximise the response to part quotes, and thus hopefully reduce
            costs,
            repairers want to be able to lookup the central PartsTrader catalogue of parts and retrieve a list of all
            parts that could be used instead.In some estimating software, there is no distinction made between a part and a  line item, as such an estimate may contain pseudo parts which incur a charge but should not be included in quote  requests for parts. For example a repairer may include 1111-OilCheck on their list of parts to indicate that they will be charging for an oil check, however this should not be submitted to PartsTrader as it either contains repair shop operational specifics that PartsTrader shouldn't know about, or it is data that PartsTrader should not be storing in the central parts repository (as this is available to all integrated repairers). In order to prevent non-standard parts being provided to PartsTrader each repairer can maintain their own exclusions list which contains a set of parts that should not be sent through to PartsTrader; it is important that our client tools use this list to exclude parts that shouldn't be uploaded.
            ‍        </p>
            <p>
            Task
            <br>
            Create a REST API that can be exposed to the client and a stub implementation. Full requirements for the
            integrated PartsTrader Parts Service are not known at present so a simple interface is required to abstract
            the
            parts lookup. Your task is to complete the implementation such that it meets the following requirements.
        </p>
        <p>            Requirement 1 - Validate Part NumberWhen given a part number the client tools should validate it to ensure
            that it conforms to the following specification:partNumber = partId "-" partCode;partId = (4 * digit);partCode =
            (4 * alphanumeric), (alphanumeric); 
            That is a part id comprising of 4 digits, followed by a dash (-), followed by apart code consisting of 4 or 
            more alphanumeric characters. So, 1234-abcd, 1234-a1b2c3d4 would be valid,a234-abcd, 123-abcd would be invalid.
        </p>
        <p>            Requirement 2 - Check Exclusions ListValid part numbers should be checked against the provided exclusions list (attached) to determine whether the part should be supplied to PartsTrader or not. If the given part number is found in the list then the part should not be sent to PartsTrader; in this scenario, the lookup should return an empty collection. The exclusion file will be updated monthly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Requirement 3 - Lookup Compatible PartsIf a valid part is supplied that is not on the exclusions list then it should be looked up via the PartsTrader Parts Service in order to retrieve any compatible parts. The results of this lookup should be returned.
        </p>
        <p>
            Assumptions
            <br>
            The following assumptions have been made in the provided framework - you are free to countermand these as you feel is appropriate to your design.
            <br>
            1. The exclusions list is a JSON file Exclusions.json (attached to this email).
            <br>
            2. Part numbers are not case sensitive.
            <br>
            3. It is sufficient to mock the details of compatible parts that will be returned, for the purpose of
            testing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Constraints
            <br>
            The main language we code in is C# and we would prefer to see your solution written in C#. Use whatever tools you are comfortable with, if you don't have access to anything we recommend you use Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/), or Visual Studio Code. Both are free and will allow you to complete the exercise.
